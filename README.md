the "smashhammer" from the leaked starbound dev assets but fixed up a little bit. because i think it's Very funny!

fixes:
- damage area actually follows the hammer
- damage repeat timeout isnt stupidly long

also:
- you can adjust damage & rotation with item parameters
- spawning one-handed smashhammers and dual wielding them is funnier :)
